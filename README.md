# wikidot_tools

Currently this repo just contains code to download wikis from wikidot.com

They are based of the two scripts from http://fancydownloader.wikidot.com/ .

#### Download Script Usage

An api key is required in order to run the script, this requires a pro user account. Also api access needs to be enabled on every website.

For example to download the following wikis you would run:

    FancyDownloader.py API_KEY mapm eweram
